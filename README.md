extract dna seq from big-genomes based blast results with your query sequences

# 1
# 3-1.single.select.seq-genome_seek_blast.pl: one way (used for the large blast results) is store all chromosomes within genome, then you could select the purpose fas within blast results.
  or 3-1.single.select.seq-blast_seek_genome.pl:  the other script for small items within blast result involved of less chromosomes;
# 3-2.combined.gene.region-genome_seek_blast.pl : scripts likey the above ones
  or 3-2.combined.gene.region-blast_seek_genome.pl
